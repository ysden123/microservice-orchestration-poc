== Example 1
Worker - link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/Worker1.scala[Worker1]

=== Running flow I
. Start conductor
. Send POST request with link:/src/main/resources/taskDefinition.json[taskDefinition.json]
. Send POST request with link:/src/main/resources/workflowDefinition.json[workflowDefinition.json]
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/WorkflowRunner.scala[Worker1Runner]
. Send POST request with link:/src/main/resources/startWorkflow.json[startWorkflow.json]
. Remember workflow ID
. Send GET request http://localhost:8080/api/workflow/8975db77-5965-459f-a4fb-51d07061c7bf?includeTasks=false (change workflow ID!!!)

=== Running flow II
. Start conductor
. Send POST request with link:/src/main/resources/taskDefinition.json[taskDefinition.json]
. Send POST request with link:/src/main/resources/workflowDefinition.json[workflowDefinition.json]
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/WorkflowRunner.scala[Worker1Runner] to register a worker
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/WorkflowRunner.scala[WorkflowRunner] to start the workflow and to get a result

=== Running flow III
Task and workflow is defined programmatic:

. Start conductor
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/TaskDefinitionCreator.scala[TaskDefinitionCreator] to register a task and workflow
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/WorkflowRunner.scala[Worker1Runner] to register a worker
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/WorkflowRunner.scala[WorkflowRunner] to start the workflow and to get a result

=== Running flow IV
Task and workflow is defined from JSON files:

. Start conductor
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/TaskDefinitionCreator2.scala[TaskDefinitionCreator2] to register a task and workflow
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/Worker1Runner.scala[Worker1Runner] to register a worker
. Run link:src/main/scala/com/stulsoft/poc/simple/worker/WorkflowRunner3.scala[WorkflowRunner3] to start the workflow and to get a result
